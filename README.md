 Abstract *: In multi tier organizations, Maintinaing workforce and attributies in workplace could become tedious in long run. In order to simplify the same we introduce HR ChatBot*

## Introduction 
*: While companies are looking to simplfy multiple workplace managmeent attributes, Both HR's and workforce tend to face diffculties with both simpler and complex tasks. In order to automate redundant tasks and simplafy work flow, this chat bot is created*

## Methods 
*: We used Python NLTK platform to train chatbot on to particular intents and give signals to run functions. These signals can later be used to perform specifi automatic searching and data handling tasks on the server side*

## Results 
*: We observed though NLTK library has been used to train the solution, Few intent based questions were'nt responded properly in the mean duration of training. THere is an additional need to increase resource and give more tags in dataset which could help in better training of the solution*
